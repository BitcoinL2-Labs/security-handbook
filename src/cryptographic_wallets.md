# Cryptographic wallets

A cryptographic wallet consists of a private key, which can be used to both find transaction outputs and spend them.  The key itself is one or more large random numbers (usually 256bits in size).  Most wallets will also create a `seed phrase`, which is a series of words which can be used to restore the private key if the wallet is lost.  Users must never store the seed phrase where it is accessible via a device, or share it with any other user.

If you are storing less than $1K, you MAY use a software wallet on your smartphone since it is more convenient to use than a hardware wallet. You MUST NOT use a browser extension on your laptop, because it is easier for an attacker to compromise it.  You SHOULD hand-write the seed phrase generated by the mobile wallet and store it in a safe place. You MUST NOT store it digitally. 

For large amounts of currency (<$1M), users must use hardware wallets, such as a Ledger device.  These keep the private key encrypted inside the device, and are resistent to tampering.  Ideally, teams will have a set of `N` devices, with transaction outputs spendable by any of the devices (`1` of `N` multisig), so hardware failures do not result in losing funds.  For a small `N = 3`, at least one of the users must keep a backup device or seed phrase in a safe deposit box.  For larger `N > 5`, the risk of leaking the backup device or seed phrase is greater than the risk all devices failing, so no backup should be made.

For even larger amounts of currency (>$1M), please [contact us](./contacts.md) for specific instructions.

## Hardware wallets

Below we will include specific instructions for configuring various hardware wallets.
